Applications of scientific machine learning techniques to study the acoustics of an apartment.

## PDE

Analysis begins by studying waves in ideal fluids using Newton's second law, conservation of mass, and the equation of state. Then the behaviour is described by a partial differential equation (PDE), the wave equation:

$$\nabla^2_x p(\textbf{x}, t) = \frac{1}{c^2}\ddot{p}(\textbf{x}, t)$$

## Solver solution

Reformulation and discretization procedures enable the numerical simulation of the system. Example solution of an initial condition problem:
